# Line Graphs using Matplotlib

This project analyzes data for a fictional online lime retailer called Sublime Limes. To gain insight into the customers and their sales habits, I used Matplotlib to create different line graphs to communicate this information.                                                                
Data is found in *sales_times.csv.*

Graphs are found in *sales_times.png.*
